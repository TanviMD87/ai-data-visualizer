# Project Name: AI-Enhanced Data Visualization App

## Description
This is an AI-powered **data visualization app** built using **Streamlit**, which allows users to upload datasets and receive meaningful insights and visualizations. The app is designed to help users explore and understand data through interactive graphs, charts, and other visual elements. It leverages AI to provide recommendations on the best visualizations for the given dataset.

## Features
- **Data Upload**: Users can upload CSV files containing their dataset.
- **AI-powered Visualization**: Based on the dataset, the app suggests suitable visualizations.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Interactive charts and graphs that allow users to explore their data.
- **Data Insights**: Get statistical summaries and key insights from the dataset.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git cd your-repository-name


2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
python -m venv venv


3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
- For **Windows**:
  ```
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- For **Mac/Linux**:
  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

4. **Install the required dependencies**:
pip install -r requirements.txt


5. **Run the app**:
streamlit run app.py


6. Open the provided URL (typically `http://localhost:8501`) in your web browser to start using the app.

## Requirements
- **Python**: 3.x+
- **Streamlit**: 1.0+
- **Other Dependencies**: All required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Folder Structure
- `assets/`: Folder containing image files, icons, etc.
- `utils/`: Contains helper functions used across the app.
- `app.py`: The main Streamlit application file.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required for the app to run.

## Usage
- Once the app is running, simply upload your dataset (CSV format) using the provided upload button.
- The app will automatically suggest the best visualizations based on the dataset and display them in an interactive dashboard.
